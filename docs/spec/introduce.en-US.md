In the process of internal desktop applications development, many different design specs and implementations would be involved, which might cause designers and developers difficulties and duplication and reduce the efficiency of development. After massive project practice and summaries, ZF Design, a design language for background applications, which aims to uniform the user interface specs for internal background projects, lower the unnecessary cost of design differences and implementation and liberate the resources of design and front-end development.

ZF Design which is specially created for internal desktop applications, is committed to improving the experience of users and product designers. User interface designers and user experience designers, collectively, are considered as product designers, and the boundaries of product managers, interaction designers, visual designers, front-end developers and develop engineers are blurred. Taking advantage of unitary specifications, ZF Design makes design and prototype more simple and accessible for all project members, which comprehensively  promotes experience and development efficiency of background applications and products.
